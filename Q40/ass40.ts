/* Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should
 take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
  information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return 
  value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to 
  make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value 
  for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that 
  includes the number of tracks on an album.*/
